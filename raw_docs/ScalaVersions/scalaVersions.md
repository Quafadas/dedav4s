# Scala Versions
## Scala 3
Is the first class citizen.

## Scala 2
Is not supported.

There's nothing fundamental about why it couldn't be cross compiled for scala 2 and I have nothing against it, this is a personal project on personal time.

# Scala JS
See [here](scalaJS.md)! One of the explicit goals of this library is to be able to cross compile the same chart you figured out in the repl, to scala JS.

# Scala Native
I have not thought of a need for this yet. In theory it would work trivially as it's all built out of sbt typelevel.
