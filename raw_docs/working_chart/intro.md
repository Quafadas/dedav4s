## DesignÂ Note

All charts are, in the end ... just a case class. For a given case class, the plot will _always_ be the same. Onen could argue that it is "functional" at that boundary. This therefore opens the potential for abstraction over charts, and in particular for unit testing strategies which have a high degree of confidence.
