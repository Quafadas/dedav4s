# Styles

There are essentially three strategies for working with a chart

1. "[Mutable](mutable.md)"
2. [The DSL](typesafe.md)
3. a [mix](mixed.md) of the two... 

The typesafe DSL is generated out of the vega [JSON schema](https://github.com/vega/schema). 

I do not believe it to be 100% correct. About 95% correct. 

For this reason, the "mutable" option is the ultimate fallback. Typesafe is pretty nice to have, though.
