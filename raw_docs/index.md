# Dedav4s

Declarative data visualization for scala - a scala plotting concept. 

It is written exclusively in scala 3 (currently), but will work with scala 2.13.6+ via forward compatibility.

If that worked, then you're ready to go! See the [plot targets](explanation/plotTargets.md) to understand what happened, and the [examples](explanation/examples.md) for suggestions on how to use and extend the concepts.

# Background Information
This is a thin shim around [vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and [vega lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). It is aimed at repl, interactive environments and exploratory analysis

It pays to have an understanding (or at least some idea of what those are), both Vega & Vega-Lite. It may be worth taking a few minutes to orient yourself with this [talk/demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uaHRWj04D4) from the creators at the Interactive Data Lab (IDL) at University of Washington.

If you are interested in plotting in general, I think that you will not regret learning a declarative paradigm.
