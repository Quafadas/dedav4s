# Elevator pitch

![3 sec pitch](/raw_docs/assets/dedav_intro.gif)

The aim is to make "simple" plotting cases as simple as possible in interactive / scripting scala environments. The idea is to expose vega / lite, in a fairly "raw" manner. There are "plot targets" for the all the "common" environments that I have wanted.

## Project status
This library works well enough for my needs now, so it's been "launched" to see if there is enthusiasm / acceptance of the paradigm. The "functional" aspects are enough for my needs. From a governance and sustainability perspective, it clearly suffers from many issues... it's a young, simple project with plenty "todo". The barrier to involvement should be rather low, should you have the desire!
