# Elevator pitch

![3 sec pitch](/raw_docs/assets/dedav_intro.gif)

The aim is to make "simple" plotting cases as simple as possible in interactive / scripting scala environments. The idea is to expose vega / lite, in a fairly "raw" manner. There are "plot targets" for the all the "common" environments that I have wanted.

## Project status
This library works well enough for my needs, and I've been using it for a couple of years now.

## Import map

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "##vega-embed": "https://esm.run/vega-embed",
    "##vega-view": "https://esm.run/vega-view"
  }
}
```
